*DBENet-NPI*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predicting ncRNA-protein interactions based on multi-perspective information and dual-branch encoder network

*Usage*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- For five datasets, you need to run the sample.py file to generate the corresponding sample.txt file ( ../data/sample.py )
- Select the dataset name and run the main.py file to train the model directly.

*Note*
